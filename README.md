# ARP-spoofing-and-detection-tools
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a protocol that resolves IP addresses to Media Access Control (MAC) addresses for transmitting data. ARP spoofing is used to link an attackerâ€™s MAC to a legitimate network IP address so the attacker can receive data meant for the owner associated with that IP address. ARP spoofing is commonly used to steal or modify or we can say knowing data but can also be used in denial of service and man-in-the-middle attacks. After ARP spoofing attacker gets the MAC address and gets the real time ARP as well. In this paper, we have tried to show how we can do the ARP spoofing perfectly between two different pcs. Then we showed how we can detect the ARP spoofing as well with our developing python tools.
